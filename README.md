# Java-EE ( Servlets, Maven) 

Hi Guy's 

I am learning JAVA EE.
To build a web application well, I need to master some concepts such as the HTTP protocol and the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.

The basis of web development with Java are the famous Servlets, which are the focus of this part of the project. 

I am learning  how to create layers, use controllers, actions, and work with requests, responses, and HTML content. And to assemble and manage the application and its dependencies professionally, I will learn  Maven too, the most popular build tool in the Java world and the foundation of most Spring projects.
